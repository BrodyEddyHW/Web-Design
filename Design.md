## Game Flow

### 1. World Map Selection
- **Starting Screen**: A 3D globe appears, with all countries grayed out.
- **Choosing a Country**:
  - Players can rotate the globe left or right using arrows to view all countries.
  - **Selecting a Country**:
    - Click on a country to highlight it.
    - The country’s flag appears with a prompt: "Do you want this as your native country?"
    - Upon confirmation, confetti flies, the country turns **green**, and all neighboring countries turn **red** (indicating they are conquerable).
- **Objective**: Start conquering adjacent countries to expand control.

### 2. Conquering Countries
- **Accessible Territories**: Players can only attempt to conquer **red countries**—those adjacent to their currently held territories.
- **Selecting a Red Country**:
  - Click on a red country to highlight it.
  - The country’s flag and a prompt appear: "Do you want to conquer this country?"
  - Confirming leads to the **minigame screen**.

### 3. Minigame: Doodle-Jump-Style Challenge
- **Objective**: Reach the top of the level to confront the "king" of the chosen country.
- **Gameplay**:
  - A default character starts at the bottom of the level.
  - The game displays a message: “Click any arrow to begin.”
  - Once a player clicks an arrow, the minigame begins:
    - **Controls**:
      - **Left/Right Arrow**: Moves the character left or right.
      - **Bounce Mechanics**: The character bounces upwards on platforms appearing randomly.
    - **Falling**: If the player misses a platform and falls, they’re returned to the world map.
    - **Final Platform**: Upon reaching the top, players must jump onto a final platform with an image of the country's king.
- **Victory**: Landing on the final platform triggers confetti, signaling the country is conquered.

### 4. Post-Victory Animation
- **Return to World Map**:
  - After conquering a country, players are returned to the world map.
  - A plane animation transports the defeated king back to the player’s native country.
  - **King’s Fate**: A humorous text appears, announcing the king’s untimely and random demise (e.g., "The plane crashed" or "They got into a car accident").
